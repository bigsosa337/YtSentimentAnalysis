WE ARE SO DIABOLICALLY BACK.
"""You're all fucking Welcome"" - Butcher 2024"
"The fact that neither Antony Starr or  Karl Urban have never received an Emmy nomination for their performance is a crime against Humanity,"
"‚ÄúYou‚Äôll no longer beloved celebrities, you will be wrathful Gods. Show me a little wrath. ‚Äú

This line from Homelander is so good!"
"Antony Starr as Homelander is as perfect as Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Charlie Cox as Daredevil, RDJ as Iron Man, Margot Robbie as Harley Quinn and Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool"
How Ashley is still here takes me beyond astonishment 
"The actor who plays Homelander managed to convey his underlying madness in the first few minutes of season 1.
Without knowing anything about the show, when I first saw him I was like,  ""There's something wrong with this 'Superman' guy.""
It was ever so subtle; in the eyes or something. 
THAT'S good acting."
"This is what you get if you tell your screenwriters ""Whatever you write - we will put it on the screen exactly the way you describe it.""."
Hearing Butcher sound so selfless for once is so refreshing for a change. This is going to be so good.
I feel like A-Train is gonna get a redemption arc while The Deep becomes an unhinged psychopath.
"I just finished Gen V and now I went back to see this trailer again.
This is the best show Prime manage to pull out there."
"""Let Fucking Go"" - Deadpool and Wolverine
""You're All Fucking Welcome"" - Billy Butcher"
Homelander‚Äôs laugh at the end sounds so incredibly maniacal. No one else can play him like Antony Starr can
I‚Äôm now gonna need a prequel spin-off showing the FIRST time Frenchie fought invincible chickens
"""Your all f***ing welcome"" was a message to the people watching this"
"2:23 Homelander laughing like the Joker is both legit terrifying but also hilarious, I wonder what‚Äôs so funny 
 No doubt a bloodbath is going down with that laugh"
"""Who wants a creamy delicious milkshake"" .. LOL, i admire Antony Starr's talent of making any line sound creepy as hell"
Give Antony Starr an Emmy already.
I love how Hughie is like the superman of the group always so positive and sees the best in people...butcher is like batman...always ten steps ahead of everyone..
"I just realized the Gen V cast is standing right next to A train 
 so glad to see the crossover happen"
Whoever cast Butcher and Homelander needs a raise. I can‚Äôt think of two people who play their roles better.
Billy's line at the end went way harder than it needed to.
I just realised this is like reverse X-Men where we‚Äôre rooting for the humans to take out the super powered people
""" I Fought For This Country, And What Did I Get For It? Forgotten ""
                                                                                                           - Soldier Boy"
"Deep looks like he‚Äôs on another level this season, he says: ‚ÄúViolence is power.‚Äù Then grabbed one of the shrimp with so much enthusiasm"
That last laugh by Anthony is terrifying.
"For those who asking the song trailer, song name es ""Running the world"" by Jarvis Cocker."
i love that this trailer feels somewhat vague and doesn‚Äôt give any super specific plots away
"From this trailer, it looks like The Deep isn't messing around anymore."
Soldier boy better come back for season 5.   He deserves a redemption arc.
"Frenchie: ""I can't believe this is happening to me AGAIN!!""
Kimiko: ...Wait, again?! "
MM without his beard is unbelievably cursed
"Karl Urban for Billy Butcher doesn't get much appreciation as Antony Starr gets for Homelander. They both have nailed their part to perfection 
üá≥üáø"
1000 bucks this guy laying dead on the floor is Stan Edgar
Toni starr  is 101% perfect cast for homelander
They brought Negan. Now all they need to do is bring Lucille.
"Karl Urban is such a beast. He's the soul of this series, just as much as Antony Starr."
I see Hughie is still living in fantasy land...
Antony Starr seriously deserves an Emmy for his portrayal as Homelander. Every scene he‚Äôs in you‚Äôre constantly in fear he‚Äôll snap‚Ä¶then the next second he‚Äôs literally clamoring for milk like a baby. Just an amazing portrayal of a truly conflicted/twisted character.
"I CANNOT see anyone else playing Butcher as perfectly as Karl Urban. 
Bravo to that man. ü´°"
‚ÄúShow me a little wrath.‚Äù Jesus Christ‚Ä¶ this can‚Äôt come soon enough. RIP Chance Perdomo
The moment the legendary homelander laugh was born.
Proud to say Antony Starr and Karl Urban are from Aotearoa New Zealand 
"""V'd UP CHICKEN!!!"" I absolutely lost my shit at that "
"Season 1: Starlight
Season 2: Ryan
Season 3: Temp V and Soldier Boy
Season 4: Supe Virus"
2:22 Homelander unlocking his inner Green Goblin!!
Why it feels like i watch the whole season by just watching this trailer 
"Every time I see Karl Urban in something I am struck by how much of an amazing actor he is, because you don't see Karl Urban you see only the character he is playing."
Antony Starr's maniacal laugh is PEAK CINEMA
"Negan:
Little pig little pig! Let me in!"
Sharing a maniac excitement as I hear Homelander's unhinged laugh at the end is when you realize just how beautifully demented this show has made us. This is going to be epic.
"""You're all f***ing welcome"" was a message to the fans."
"The look kimiko gives frenchie when he says "" i cant believe this is happening to me again "" with the chicken on v is hilarious."
Antony Starr as Homelander is the 101% Extra Perfect Casting.
Literally just watched the whole 3 seasons in the past 3 days and now all I have to wait is a couple more for the 4th season!!!
"No Fucking Doubt, Antony Star born to play Homelander "
"From killing his whole team to ""I can't do it without you""

Series Butcher surpassed the comic one in every single way"
How time flies. The first trailer was already 5 months ago!!!
"As I see, we're gonna get a lot more bloody scenes in this season, which looks awesome"
"Everyone is talking about the actors, but what I saw in this trailer was some killer VFX."
2:22 Homelander laughing is something I never thought I need.
CATE AND SAM SPOTTED LETS FUCKING GO
"Most underrated, or just overlooked, series ever. One of the best programmes I've ever seen. 10/10!"
Starlight is definitely killing the deep 
"Kimiko being all ""Wait, this has happened before?"" kills me lmao."
Hopefully soldier boy comes back
"LOL Kimiko's face when Frenchie says ""I can't beleive this is happening AGAIN"""
1:43 Skyrim Chicken finally makes its Hollywood Debut
Homelander starting his joker arc
I‚Äôm pretty sure the dead body homelander burns is STAN EDGAR
"""if we're ever gonna win against monsters,we need to start acting human""

Hughie....i love you Bud."
0:26 GIVE MY MAN MM HIS BEARD BACK 
Eagerly waiting for this season
"""Insanely desperate's where we are, don‚Äôt you think, love?""

I mean, he‚Äôs not wrong. "
Everyone is praising Antony Star and he really deserves this but let's not forget how excellently amazing Karl Urban is and  as Billy Butcher. He also deserves the same appreciation as Antony Star got.
"2:22 
Homelander with that Joker laugh"
When is season 5 coming out!?
"Oh, Kimiko's reaction to, ""I can't believe this is happening to me again""."
That laugh from Homelander at the end sent shivers down my spine. Truly chilling.
"Honestly this show is one of the best shows out there, with Disney‚Äôs not making as good Marvel Movies etc this show would make so much money if you guys decided to take this series to the big screen."
2:14 I predict that Frenchie and Kimiko leave and get their chance to start over
I just hope Soldier Boy gets another crack at Homelander. Always refreshing to see HL not be portrayed as invincible.
"I have reason to believe the body homelander burns is the dead black noirs because the head looks similar to the helmet and the pose, and the public don't know he died so they'd have to cover it up"
Negan went from killing Z's to V's
Finally Karl Urban is back in action after what felt a decades of wait!!
I love the way the boys knows how to put out a good and intriguing trailer w/o spoiling too much. They show just enough but I still don‚Äôt know wtf is going on
"Anthony Starr is great as Homelander, but Karl Urban needs to get the recognition he deserves too. He‚Äôs awesome as Butcher "
"Black Noir is back.
Billy with a crowbar.
Virus that can kill supes.
Mutated super animals.
Freaking great."
Homelander as Anthony Star is literally peak casting
Looks craaaaaazyyyy. The different kinds of Sup's seen are intriguing
"""Who wants a creamy delicious milkshake?""
Of course HE'D be the one saying that"
As a Janitor who works for Vought Industries Cleaning Services I can assure you things are well under control.
"That lough from Homelander is everything, i swear!!!!"
And two Kiwis taking the leads. Great work boys.
"That Thumbail is the new ""Does He Know"""
"Homelander: who wants a creamy delicious milkshake?

My brain: Y U M M E R S"
We cannot wait for this season!!
mother's milk aged fast AF
"Soldier boy was the best thing in season 3, I hope he comes back"
Homelander's laugh at 2:22 is just... diabolical!
2:23 Thank You!
I could watch this trailer forever
"Rest in Peace, Chance Perdomo (Actor for Andre in Gen V), you will be missed."
2:22 that Evil laughter by Homelader 
I just want Kimiko and frenchie to be happy hahahha
this season is DIABOLICAL
Antony's Homelander is one of the best villians oat.
"Therapist: Beardless M.M. isn‚Äôt real. Beardless M.M. can‚Äôt hurt you. 

Beardless M.M.:"
Who else have to turn on the subtitles only to understand William butcher
We're all waitingi for this season!
"Antony starr as homelander is 
% Perfect cast"
"Karl Urban is such an underrated actor.
Always happy he got the role he deserved.

And Anthony Starr killed it !!!"
0:26.... BWAHAHAHAHA!!!  Starlight looks RIDICULOUS!!!
Thank God for heroes like Homelander his father must be proud
You know it‚Äôs bad when Neegan asks for help 
after 3 seasons it looks like we finally see The Deep in a fight scene
"0:30 For a second, I was wondering why does it look like they censored Marvin... but then I realized, it was just a poorly placed computer screen. "
"2:20
Was Homelander making Deep eat fish again? Or is that someone else? Notice the boots."
"""V'd up chicken"" killed me :D"
Kimiko's face when she hears that it happened once before
"We all know we will watch this, there is no need for a trailer"
"We're eagerly waiting for that series only
Thanks amazone"
"""Kimiko 's cuteness rivals the evil genius of Homeledaner! 
Ô∏è‚Äç"
I‚Äôm already missing Jensen Ackles as soldier boy. But I‚Äôm excited for another fantastic season.
"I'm looking forward to this season like I was looking forward to the second season. 


And man was I looking forward to the second season"
"""You're all fucking Welcome"""
I‚Äôm actually so extremely glad that they‚Äôre including story beats and characters from Gen V. I expected them to hold off on that  until season 5 but seeing Sam and Kate there got me even more hype. So excited for this season
Fallout ‚Ä¶ Clarkson‚Äôs Farm and now Boys is back. Fair play Prime 
I have NEVER been so READY
Violence is a hallmark of all Hollywood movies and tv serials
NO ONE IS TALKING ABOUT GEN V??? IMMA CRY I AM SO STOKED
"I lost it at the invincible chicken. Also, that quote from Hughie is such a good message. You can't triumph over evil if you fight it purely on it's own level; a better world can't be built on blood alone. This season's gonna be great, I can't wait."
Soldier Boy is too good of a character not to bring back. I hope he‚Äôs in season 4. At least a cameo or something
Is no one gonna talk about Sam and cate at 1:00
Surprised there making another season. This trailer gives off final season vibes.
"I can still feel the heroic everwatching presence of Translucent, may he rest in pieces"
I want Soldier Boy back.
I'm going to celebrate the Boys being back with a delicious glass of milk. lol
No soldier boy? 
So wish Karl Urban had reprised his role as Judge Dredd. One of the best films EVER
that laugh from homelander was DIABOLICAL
The Boys is like Amazon Prime's Golden Boy 
"Yo, Kimiko's smile was all i needed.  We're all gonna be okay."
i miss you Soldier BOY
Frenchie saying ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt believe this happening to me again‚Äù while shooting a bunch of chickens. Kimiko is shocked like how did this even happen once before.
I just finished gen v and you can see the connection between two of these shows. Can‚Äôt wait to see season 4.
Who is counting down the days?
Kimiko's smile at 1:29. Karen Fukuhara is such a gem.
BOYS X GEN V this will be a deadly combination
Karl Urban is simply phenomenal!
Better not stop at ep 4
RIP Chance Perdomo. I hope the producers dedicate an episode to your memory. 
We really about to see Homelander go fully unhinged this season.
ONLY 12 DAYS PEOPLE 
Solger boy fans like button 
"The casting for this whole series is perfect.  

Homelander is the best villain we‚Äôve had in ages. All of The Boys crew are amazing at their roles too.  

This is going to be amazing."
Sam and Cate from Gen V is a welcome addition. Now for the season finale to have Starlight free the Godolkin 4 and be their team leader in Gen V season 2
They better bring back soldier boy
This is blatantly the best trailer ever made
"Homelander's laugh at the end is terrifying, almost green goblin esq"
I swear if y'all do a pause after 4 episodes...
"sam and cate from gen v are gonna be nuts, they are so powerful"
We need interviews already 
"Armin- To rise above monsters, we have to abandon our humanity! Fight fire with fire!"
Anyone notice the color grade change? Colors are looking way more vibrant and less greyed out
Missing Soldier boy. Without him looks like missing something in a master piece. Rest is awesome.
And now Negan in the team!!
I don't understand how they are able to make each season more insane than the last... But I'll happily keep watching
I have so many alarms set so I don't miss the release day
Can't believe tehy pulled invincible chicken haha
2:23 that laugh though 
"I think it would be almost poetic if A-Train sacrificed himself like Queen Maeve did in the comics, only instead of trying to protect Starlight, he's trying to protect Hughie. 

When we first see A-Train he irreparably changes Hughie's life, the last time we see him, he's just saved his life."
"‚Ä™2:34‚Ä¨ 
Very excited"
"Season 4 premieres June 13th with 3 episodes with are titled:

1- Department of Dirty Tricks: This could mean Neuman giving another task to Homelander to eliminate her and Singer‚Äôs electoral rival or blackmailing the rival with some photos/videoes

2- Life Among the Septics: Septics basically means something that is infected. Remember the scenes in the teaser of the season where Kimiko fights Neuman‚Äôs now superpowered daughter and MM faces off against a supe that breaks itself into two (See the teaser again and stop at  and ). That could be it

3- We‚Äôll Keep the Red Flag Flying Here: ‚ÄúRed Flag‚Äù here is probably used to mean Blood and the boys are probably on an adventure to another country. This could be the episode with the superpowered Chicken and the flying squirrels or whatever that is"
"Still sad about the Gen V actor, Chance Perdomo... So Unfortunate. Rip, man."
"My god, Anthony starr just gets better and better. That absolutely unhinged green goblin laugh at the end gave me chills"
"I CANNOT WAIT 
I really hope they'll be able to recreate the scene with Homelander and Stillwell from the original comics where Homelander desperately tries to intimidate Edgar"
i cant wait for this
Ashley is clinging on for dear life at this point 
"Karl Urban as Billy Butcher, what a fucking legend. The rest are all great, but he's the reason I always come back to The Boys."
Release date ?
I NEED THIS SEASON ALREADY
That Sinister laugh of HOMELANDER though.
"1:38
Deep's best feat lmao"
I hope we get 3 episodes again for the start 
"This is one of the best trailers I've ever seen in my life. So much in it, the haunting music, just genius. Primes best show hands down!"
Gen V already having major tie ins with sam showing up in the tailer as well as the post credit scene of Butcher finding the forest with the supe killing virus
That chicken has built different like a nokia
Hell yeah we were all waiting for  you guys 
"I'm glad Cameron Crovetti, who plays Ryan, got promoted from reaccuring character to a regular character on season 4. He's a talented young actor and has great chemistry with both Anthony Starr and Karl Urban. Also, I've been loving the scenes between Homelander and Ryan. Ryan makes Homelander seem more human when he's around him and the tension between Butcher and Homelander vying for custody of Ryan is a great watch. Can't wait to see if Ryan goes to the darkside or his late Mom's influence can keep him good."
Bro why is nobody talking the fact that black noir is back or the fact that the cast of gen v is always in this season which ties gen v directly to season 4
Homelander's laugh is gonna give head to head competition to joker's laugh
"""Your all Fucking welcome."" 
- Billy Butcher 2024"
Already rewatched all seasons of The Boys as well as season 1 of Gen V to prepare for it 
"I had a coworker of mine who recently passed away earlier this year who loved the Boys and anything comic book related, such as Invincible, Marvel, DC etc etc. I really wish he was still here to watch this season. He turned me on to all of these shows. RIP Alex!!  A real-life superhero!!!!
Ô∏è
Ô∏è
Ô∏è"
‚ÄúThis is perfect from inch to minute detail it's perfect ‚Äù
I hope Ryan doesn‚Äôt go too far. I want him to be redeemed.
"And just to image how they had to completely rewrite the comics into an original and fresh idea, truly diabolical"
I really hope thats the real Black Noir back. His whole ability his healing.
Shoutout to Frenchie and Kimiko.  Can't wait to see the insanity next month.
Can‚Äôt wait! Maybe Sam from Gen V is the new Black Noir?
"Two things:

1.  I think this show‚Äôs getting close to ending.  Seems like the story may be reaching its conclusion.

2.  I feel like Marie from Gen V may be integral to killing Homelander."
"We need soldier boy to return, provide some colourful dialogue and try to balance taking on Homelander, Butcher and the rest of the crew "
"It's been a long journey 
 glad to witness it. Ready for more diabolical shinnaningans "
Mother‚Äôs Milk looks different.
2:09 ...wait where'd he get the milk for those milkshakes?!
"That manic laugh from Homelander at the end literallu gave me chills, god i love Anthony Starr"
12 year old me watching the boys knowimg it's 18+:
Give Antony Starr an Oscar. 
"Really nice to see how GenV‚Äôs characters seem to be integrated into the show seamlessly 
 GenV did some great job of world building."
Antony Starr was born for that bloody role. LFG 
This show is just getting more and more outa control and I'm here for all of it.
"Throw chaos, mayhem, madness, and a pinch of comedy in the blender and out pours a smooth drink called THE BOYS SEASON 4"
"So Deep, New Black Noir, and the new girl are completely on board with Homelander‚Äôs plans, while A-Train seems not really for it. That‚Äôs just what i gathered"
Bring Back SOLDIER BOY!!!
I was waiting for Jeffery Morgan to get some Negan action 
Aint no way we got Negan helping Billy Butcher
MM without the beard makes it look like they recast him.
"0:51: Is that Todd in the background

0:44: Homelander in what I think is left of ‚ÄúThe Woods‚Äù

: Hopefully what I assume is Ezekiel‚Äôs death

: Sam and Kate (Gen V)

: The New Noir

: Newmans Daughter (I think)"
that homelander laugh 
"Unless you haven't seen The Boys comic's, you already know who the new Black Noir is and I can't wait for Homelander to meet him."
"RIP Chance Perdomo
He would have been great for this season along with the other Gen V cast that are going to be in it."
1:00 Cate & Sam GEN-V just finished watching it. Ready for a new season of THE BOYS
More giggles and laughter coming my way.. 
The only show that knows how to do it right anymore
This and Invincible have to be the best 2 shows about super heroes on any network.
"the homelander's laugh at the near end, really hit"
ARE WE JUST GONNA IGNORE NEGAN IN THE BOYS
flying killer sheep looool that tops the killer bunnies from monthy pytons holy grail 
Homelander ice skating and laughing manically were by far the best parts of the trailer.  He really does carry this show.
Karl urban as Billy Butcher and Antony starr as Homelander are ruthlessly good
that Ricky Gervais laugh is epic
"Everyone talking about Homelander, but nobody remembers that Butcher is the main character and GOAT."
Easily Primes best original.
I wish they could also cast Jared Padelecki in this show....that way they have the entire trifecta of father and sons.
Have you guys noticed there‚Äôs more definition in homelander‚Äôs suit as the series goes on? In season one it barely had any abs and it looked bulky af but as the show progresses it‚Äôs getting more muscular. Just a weird thing I just noticed while watching it back.
Using THAT Jarvis Cocker song was inspired.
"Trailers really need to start adding the credits to the songs in the description. 
Jarvis cocker- Running the world"
Every one is expecting HOMELANDER to lose his sanity. After that 2:22 Sinister Laugh I'm pretty sure we are going witness a complete mad man.
"Just now finished the whole searies; well, partially!"
Prime owning the super hero genre rn like: I am better‚Ä¶ I AM BETTER
"2:11
Hughie really is the heart of the show
ü•π"
MM looks so much skinnier!!? Like mega noticeably skinnier. Hope he‚Äôs alright.
Here we go again baby 
Hope they bring back soldier boy
"""SEASON 4 IS HERE""
Prime video: ""you all fuckin welcome."""
"People who demand Soldier boy's return assemble
Ô∏è"
we can't wait more mate's.... 
"I don't care about anything else, the fact that black noir is back makes me happy as hell :D"
2:02 here comes luffy supe death scene
its here the boys really feel more like a team in this season
When ?
Name of the song please!
John Winchester still killing MONSTERS
"Flying Sheeps
Un-killable Chickens

This show just got better "
"All characters:
Ô∏è
Homelander:"
Excellent use of an excellent Jarvis Cocker song.
Glad to see that the writers are incorporating Gen V and not just leaving it as a separate entity with occasional cameos!
"We need some kind of ""previously, on the Boys"" video regarding season 3"
NEGAN IS ACTUALLY CANON IN THE BOYS
We are Negan
It‚Äôs been like 10 years waiting for this season. Almost forgot about the show all together.
Homerlander's laugh at the end was fucking diabolical
"The first season was the match.
Every season after it has been the fuse.
And we all can't wait for the big bad boom."
‚ÄúYou‚Äôre all fucking welcome‚Äù
I hope Gen V we will see more of the Gen V cast this season. But it‚Äôs gonna be hard without Andre.
"In the words of soldier boy: ""I Fought For This Country, And What Did I Get For It? Forgotten."""
Is this gonna be the final season or did they Green light a 5th already?
I love deep his finally getting some actions here
This looks incredible. Butcher sounds a lot more appreciate of his team. Saying he can‚Äôt do anything he‚Äôs doing without them. The supes look like they‚Äôre going to be at their worst this season. This is going to be soooo goooood.
0:58 That's a Gen V crossover there. 
We need soldier boy back.
"Hopefully they hired a proper fight choreographer this time around. It wouldn‚Äôt hurt to increase the budget just a smidge. Hate to say it, but the trailers have been the best part of the last couple seasons. On a positive note, homelander looks absolutely maniacal. Hopefully that isn‚Äôt something reserved for the last episode of the season."
2:22 that laugh though. Diabolical!
"2:16 Superpowered Sheep? 

Okay S4 is Already Peak"
I need this on my tv RIGHT NOW
Looks good but I can‚Äôt forget about Soldier boy the guy was badass
Homelander is so good at acting as Anthony Star!
The bullet proof chicken part is DIABOLICAL  
It's the guy from the other show! Gonna be cool to see how he interacts with homelander
THIS LOOKS ABSOLUTELY DIABOLICAL!
2:23 Homelander Man-Child's Laugh
Give Antony Starr an Emmy already!
We're ready
What happened to Solider Boy?
So good to see the Gen V characters here ! Badly needed closure. They left that storyline in such a cliffhanger.
"""its home landing time"" said homelander shortly after the ending of the trailer"
"As long as you have a smile on your face, don't curse, and don't raise your voice.  You can cave a person's head in and still be a hero."
You know the things are gonna happen when Homelander laughs
"The only reason I watched the very first episode was because of Karl Urban. He and the rest of the cast, the writing, and the special effects are what made me keep watching. I love this show! "
I have to admit homelander's laugh was the best part
10 more days!!!!!
I'm hoping Billy took compound V so he'd be able to pound supes like he did in the comic.
2:22 the laugh of homelander it's insane good
homelander laughing 2:22 is the best thing i have seen in a long time
Anyone here after it was renewed for season 5
It best have soldier boy in it or I‚Äôd be disappointed
I hope that Soldier Boy comes back in the future.
"1:48 That look she gives is like ""again?"""
0:59 - Hello GenV Crew
